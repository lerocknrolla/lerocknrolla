# Hello!

I am a **classical musician** and **teacher** now studying part-time for a new degree in **Mathematics**. I had an incredible experience with the programming courses, thanks to the great professor [Jo√£o Neto](https://github.com/jpneto), so I will be pursuing a minor in **Computer Science**.

In my introductory programming courses, we learned **Python** and its major libraries, classes and OOP, data structures (stacks, queues, priority queues, BSTs, *etc*), and algorithms (including sorting and searching). I've been expanding on some object classes and small projects we did in class, so I decided to upload those here.

I am teaching myself **C** and getting some practice with it by solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, and have learned **HTML** and **CSS** as well. I'm also proficient in **Csound** and **Pure Data**, along with other music-specific technologies.

Since classical music and schools both have an off-season in the summer, I'm using that opportunity to try to get some real-life programming experience under my belt, so I'd love to work on an **intership** or **junior programmer** role from **July** to **September**!
